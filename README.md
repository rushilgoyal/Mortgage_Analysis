# Mortgage_Analysis
A Collapse in U.S housing prices helped trigger a severe economic meltdown in the fall of 2008.One of the contributing factors was that many homeowners had taken on mortgages that ended up having unexpected consequences.

In Mortgages one borrowed money from a bank and made a fixed size payment each month for the life of the mortgage, which typically ranged from 15 to 30 years.At the end of thst period ,the bank had been paid back the initial loan + interest,and the homeowner owned the house "free and clear" Now what happened that mortgages were getting complicated day by day.People could get lower interest rates by playing "Points" at the time they took on the mortgages.A point is a cash payment of 1% of the value of the loan.People could get mortgages that were "interest only" for the period of time.There were loans which involved multiple rates.Typically the initial rate called "teaser rate" was low,and then it went up over time.Many of these loans were variable-rate the rate to be paid after the intial period would vary depending upon some index intended to reflect the cost to the lender of borrowing ont he wholesale credit market.
